## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Clinton Keller, a web developer and graphic designer from the Chicago suburbs, passionate about blending creativity with technology. Iâ€™m currently working on my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Graphic Information Technology (GIT) with a focus on Full-Stack Web Development. My expertise lies in front-end design, UI/UX, and modern web technologies, but I also enjoy tackling backend development to build seamless, responsive digital experiences. With a strong background in visual design, I bring a unique artistic approach to coding, ensuring that both form and function work harmoniously. Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome! ðŸš€
